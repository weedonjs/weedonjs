Hi, I’m @weedonjs.
 - I’m interested in backend architecture
 - I’m currently learning literally everything from scratch
 - I’m looking to collaborate on the basics, but not quite there yet
 - How to reach me is best through email, might as well be a boomer at this point, a bit of a heathen when it comes to social media
