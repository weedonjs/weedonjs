- 👋 Hi, I’m @weedonjs
- 👀 I’m interested in backend architecture
- 🌱 I’m currently learning literally everything from scratch
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the basics, but not quite there yet
- 📫 How to reach me is best through email, might as well be a boomer at this point, a bit of a heathen when it comes to social media
